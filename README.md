# HackWithMe

Many hackers enter hackathons with an undeveloped idea. Even worse is the amount of time hackers use up developing it during the hackathon. In the limited amount of time, the ideas hackers develop come no where near its potential. With HackWithME, hackers are able to avoid this problem. 

HackWithMe allows hackers nearby to connect and collaborate on developing an idea and a plan prior to a hackathon. This helps build early team chemstry and encorages working together outside of hackathons. 

This platform provides a quick and easy way to trade contact info and helps find the right hackers that compliment each other's skills. One simply needs to press a button to notify other hackers from a list that one believes they can successfully and efficently work together. If the recipent is interested they can reply back with contact info provides from whoever notified them.

By using this platform, a team can code their project right when a hackathon starts with specific plans resulting in a more complete project to ship after the hackathon.
