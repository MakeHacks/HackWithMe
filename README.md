# HackWithMe
  HackWithMe is a cutting-edge platform built on MaterialCSS which aims to provide a seemless and simplified platform for connecting hack-a-thon attendees with other nearby attendees before an event. An opportunity to meet new people with similar interests, coordinate on transportation and any necessary housing, and generate viable ideas allows for higher productivity during a hack-a-thon.
