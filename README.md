# HackWithMe

#Our Problem
Armaiz has been to 3 hackathons the past 4 weeks and each time had met with a team last minute discussing and forming ideas. This was a very disorganized and inefficent way of forming a well developed idea .His team spent so much time thinking rather than coding and with no clear specifications on what the design was or what each feature did due to rushing through designing an idea. This is what we want to prevent. We believe every idea deserves the proper attention to be fully planned out and shipped. Without the proper planning, an idea can be easily destroyed or not reach its full potential.


#What is it
Many hackers enter hackathons with an undeveloped idea. Even worse is the amount of time hackers use up developing it during the hackathon. In the limited amount of time, the ideas hackers develop come no where near its potential. With HackWithME, hackers are able to avoid this problem. 

HackWithMe allows hackers nearby to connect and collaborate on developing an idea and a plan prior to a hackathon. This helps build early team chemstry and encorages working together outside of hackathons. 

This platform provides a quick and easy way to trade contact info and helps find the right hackers that compliment each other's skills. One simply needs to press a button to notify other hackers from a list that one believes they can successfully and efficently work together. If the recipent is interested they can reply back with contact info provides from whoever notified them.

By using this platform, a team can code their project right when a hackathon starts with specific plans resulting in a more complete project to ship after the hackathon. 


#Challenges Faced
We all created our individual goals to have roadblocks in the way. Whether it be using apis (Google Maps), AngularJS, discovering new frameworks or learning mongoDB, each of us set goals which we knew we would spend time on fixing bugs or finding out how to code it. Brandon was completly new to mongoDB and spent hours debugging figuring out how to utilize it properly. Armaiz was completely new to AngularJS and had to read the docs figuring out which feature would fit with our project. Ganesh had trouble with formating Google Maps Api to make it full screen and still display properly along with learning the api itself. Vishal being a newcomer to using frameworks began to learn materializeCSS and had to read the docs and understand every key feature especially the grid system.

#Whats Next
Since this is something we all would love to use and we have it right on our fingertips, it makes the most sense to develop it with the help of the Hackathon community. This is targeted to help hackers, so why shouldn't us hackers work together to form the perfect solution to fully design, code and ship an idea before, during, and after a hackathon.
